# LoRa Alpha Communication

This repository serves as a testing bench for the integration of the Atmega microcontrollers with LoRa network communications. For ease of complexity in debugging, a the Serial port is used as a transport layer for the communication between a backend server and a "central" LoRa-enabled device. Messages will be sent into the device and then relayed to other devices in the network.
